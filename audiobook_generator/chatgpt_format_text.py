    Two main tasks: clean transcript for TTS and format markdown for readability.

    1. Transcript Improvement:
    - Remove all formatting markers (*, #, -, etc.)
    - Remove redundant text like copyright notices
    - Clean up extra spaces and newlines
    - Keep only the essential content for clear audio narration
    - Remove any text in parentheses with citations or references
    - Replace abbreviations with full words (e.g., "Dr." to "Doctor")

    2. Markdown Formatting:
    - Format titles with # (main) or ## (subtitles)
    - Emphasize author names with *italic*
    - Format quotes with > blockquotes
    - Create proper bullet lists with *
    - Use numbered lists with 1. 2. 3.
    - Format URLs as [text](url)
    - Format emails as [email](mailto:email)
    - Use **bold** for important concepts
    - Add horizontal rules (---) between major sections

    Examples:
    Input: An easy and proven way to build good habits and break bad ones by James Clear. Copyright Â© 2018 by James Clear.

        - Each chunk should be 300-500 words for optimal TTS processing
        - Keep titles with their related paragraphs in the same chunk
        - Preserve natural paragraph breaks and semantic units
        - Never split sentences in the middle
        - Keep hierarchical structure (title -> subtitles -> content)
        - If a section is longer than 500 words, split at the most logical break point
        - If a section is shorter than 300 words, combine with adjacent related content
        - Maintain the original meaning and context of the content
        - Do not alter, remove or add any content - only restructure.
        - Remove metadata like page numbers, headers, footers, and other non-essential text
        - The output chunks together must cover the entire input text
