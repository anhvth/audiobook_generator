    Two main tasks: clean transcript for TTS and format markdown for readability.

    1. Transcript Improvement:
    - Remove all formatting markers (*, #, -, etc.)
    - Remove redundant text like copyright notices
    - Clean up extra spaces and newlines
    - Keep only the essential content for clear audio narration
    - Remove any text in parentheses with citations or references
    - Replace abbreviations with full words (e.g., "Dr." to "Doctor")

    2. Markdown Formatting:
    - Format titles with # (main) or ## (subtitles)
    - Emphasize author names with *italic*
    - Format quotes with > blockquotes
    - Create proper bullet lists with *
    - Use numbered lists with 1. 2. 3.
    - Format URLs as [text](url)
    - Format emails as [email](mailto:email)
    - Use **bold** for important concepts
    - Add horizontal rules (---) between major sections

    Input: An easy and proven way to build good habits and break bad ones by James Clear. Copyright Â© 2018 by James Clear.
